# Telegram-IP-Bot
This bot will return the public IP address of the host machine.

This is useful in cases where, for example, one runs an SSH server but their ISP randomly reassigns IP addresses. Message the bot on Telegram and it will return the IP address of the machine it is being run on.

# Install Instructions
coming soon.
